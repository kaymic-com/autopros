# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# SERVICES = JSON.parse File.read("#{Rails.root}/lib/assets/services.json"), object_class: OpenStruct
# SERVICES.each do |site|
# 	Service.find_or_create_by() do |new_site|
#
# 	end
# end
